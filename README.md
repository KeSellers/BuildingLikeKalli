# BuildingLikeKalli
I want to brain a CNN that takes a picture of furniture, decorations, balconies, gates etc and replace them with a look a like in forged optics.

Kalli is a friend of mine who is a blacksmith by heart. He stands out with his unique and creative metal design. I wish to build up an AI that takes an image of a costumers old fence or balcony etc, replaces it with a newly generated fence in Kallis wonderful and unique style. 
The idea is adapted from the "painting like van gogh" project.
